# Vocabularies

In case I want to add my own elements to the application profile that are not part of CCMM or another usable vocabulary, I define them in my new vocabulary, which I then use in the application profile.

## Adding existing vocabularies to the project

I can use frequently used vocabularies (well known vocabularies), import vocabulary through URL (vocabulary from URL - the link to the vocabulary must be in [TTL](slovník-pojmů.md#rdf) format), or define my own.

I create a new vocabulary and add new concepts (plus symbol). I must fill in the name, IRI, and definition.
Subsequently, I add the defined concepts to the application profile.
