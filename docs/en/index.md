# Methodology for Metadata Profile Management
This document is a Methodology for Metadata Profile Management primarily for the purposes of the NRP - National Repository Platform project.
It serves mainly the administrators of individual metadata profiles of repositories, if the common metadata profile [CCMM](https://ccmm.cz) is not sufficient for them.
It describes how the tool [Dataspecer](https://dataspecer.com) developed for this purpose can be used for creating and managing metadata profiles, which is briefly described in [another part of the methodology](dataspecer.md).

Prerequisites for using this methodology are:

1. Understanding the issues of vocabularies and application profiles
2. Identified need for creating a new application profile
3. Definition of needs addressed by the new application profile, i.e., what from CCMM is needed, what is not, what concepts from which other vocabularies are needed, and how they should be connected in the new application profile.

When the prerequisites are met, you can proceed to the section [about basic operation of the Dataspecer tool](dataspecer.md).
