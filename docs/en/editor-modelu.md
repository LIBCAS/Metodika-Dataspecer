![ Catalog](../assets/images/katalog.webp) 

In the main interface, we see a catalog on the left side. It contains elements that we can add to our own application profile.

In the top interface, I have the option to save my work (save button). Work needs to be saved regularly.
There is no automatic saving in Dataspecer.
